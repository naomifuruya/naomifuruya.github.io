               <h3>Your Life is What You Make It</h3>
               <p>
                  Your life is what you make it. Your present life is the result of all the choices you have made up until this moment. You are the only one responsible for where you are right now, for how your life looks, for how you are being treated by those around you and for the level of happiness or unhappiness present in your life. If you want to change the quality of your life, if you want to change the quality of the relationships you have, you have to start by taking responsibility for everything!
