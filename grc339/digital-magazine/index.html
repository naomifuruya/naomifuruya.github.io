               <h3>Your Life is What You Make It</h3>
               <p>
                  Your life is what you make it. Your present life is the result of all the choices you have made up until this moment. You are the only one responsible for where you are right now, for how your life looks, for how you are being treated by those around you and for the level of happiness or unhappiness present in your life. If you want to change the quality of your life, if you want to change the quality of the relationships you have, you have to start by taking responsibility for everything!

                  <p>
                     With the Pandemic keeping us away from one another, we looked around for outlets to help manage out mental wellness, but opportunities were far less frequent, due to the pandemic. That is where the outdoors came in.

                     If you ask the average person if they truly love themselves, the answer is typically "no." Why? Self love is hard, but it is so important.

                     Are there people from your high school you haven't talked to in over a few years? Or someone you just want to talk to but are too scared to reach out to them? Well, guess what? They might feel the same way, so until either of you take the initiative to call, that streak will continue.
