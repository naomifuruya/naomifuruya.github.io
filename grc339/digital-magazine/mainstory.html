            <h2>Your Life is What You Make It</h2>
            <p> Your life is what you make it. Your present life is the result of all the choices you have made up until this moment. You are the only one responsible for where you are right now, for how your life looks, for how you are being treated by those around you and for the level of happiness or unhappiness present in your life. If you want to change the quality of your life, if you want to change the quality of the relationships you have, you have to start by taking responsibility for everything. Yes, everything! If you keep on doing the same things over and over again, you will get the same results, over and over again. Your life will change the moment you decide it is time to change, it’s that simple. It all starts with a thought, an idea and based on that the actions you will take will lead you in a different and new direction. Will lead you in the right direction. Its you and you only!</p>

            <p>First, it’s important that you’re injury-free and healthy. Handstands place stress on the wrists and shoulders and require adequate mobility in the lower back and hamstrings. If you have any pain in these areas, hold off until you’re back in action. A good warm-up is essential to injury prevention. Begin with a yoga session or your favorite moves to loosen up and open your shoulders and activate your arm, core, and back muscles. 
               As you work toward the real deal, start with the first three moves of this exercise progression, and continue until you find them easy and comfortable before moving on to practicing a handstand pose with a wall. Move at your own pace, and remember, consistent practice is key.

            <p>After my last marathon, I was in agony and unable to put weight on my foot. Knowing that I didn’t want to exacerbate my injury, I made an appointment, with my now-former doctor’s office, and went in to the doctor on call. As I hobbled into the exam room, I told the doctor that I was a runner, had just finished my second marathon and I thought I had pulled something in my foot. She took a moment, looked me up and down, eyeing the pooch of my stomach pushing against my size 10 jeans, and asked, “And did you train for this race?” Bewildered and on the verge of tears, I said, “Yes, for months. Of course, I trained.”</p>
