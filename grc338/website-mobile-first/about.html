                <h2>About Us</h2>
                <p>Firas Marsarweh founded the Troy Cuisine in 1983, opening the first restaurant in San Diego, California. He grew up cooking with his mother, and that turned into his passion, and eventually led to him opening multiple restaurants. The menu incorporates the many recipes he learned when he was younger, as well as some new ones he has developed on his own. A popular favorite amongst customers are the falafels. One of the main reasons for this are that they are freshly and perfectly fried, served with homemade sauces. We make all of our sauces and dishes from scratch, ensuring that we know where the ingredients are from and also so that we can deliver delicious foods.</p>
