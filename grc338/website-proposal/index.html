            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Eat4U</p>
            <p>Eat4U's goal is to provide the homeless and individuals who are unable to afford food with not only food, but food that fits their needs. A lot of times, individuals are not given thep privilege to choose what food they eat. If they want to be a vegetarian, they cannot always find or afford food that supports that; if they are gluten-free, it limits their already limited options. Hopefully one meal at a time, we can change this. </p>
            <h2>Target audience</h2>
            <p>This program is successful solely by the heart of others. A purchase of a meal is donated to a homeless individual or individuals who are unable to afford a meal. Everyone who would love to donate and support less fortunate individuals are encouraged to visit this site.</p>
            <p>Individuals who visit this site are here to support another human being who happens to be less fortunate than them. Their donation equates to food on another human beings' plate.</p>

                <p>To donate, select a meal that you think someone would enjoy and select "donate me". All meals are $5.00. You can also select the "choose for me" option, and we will choose a meal that we think someone would love to eat. Each meal comes with a dessert (such as a fruit cup) and a drink.</p>
                <p>Every week, we select 7 new meals from our list of delicious healthy meals.</p>
                <p>If you would like to donate money for ingredients for meals, that would be greatly appreciated as well. Please click here if you are able.</p>

                <h1>About</h1>
                <p>Eat4U was founded in 2020 by Naomi Furuya. She was inspired by her Aunt Evelyn Cheatham who had a restaurant that served everyone, with a pay what you can policy. It was run by youth that she trained who came from a difficult background. She provided them with free culinary training and helped guide them to the right path. Naomi saw how much she did for her community every year â€” from serving meals and cookies to the homeless every holiday and every opportunity she had to helping the fire victims in Santa Rosa by providing them all free meals.</p>
                <p>Eat4U has the same mentality, where everyone who needs help will get it. Naomi realizes that the first step is being able to provide a meal to everyone and that healthy food should be the second step, but she also questions why you can't try to do both at the same time. With the help of this community, hundreds are able to be fed every month. She envisons for this program to grow, and be able to help as many people as possible.</p>
